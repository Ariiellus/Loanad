# LOANAD

**LOANAD** is an onchain peer-to-peer (P2P) lending protocol deployed on **Monad**.
Its purpose is to democratize access to credit in Latin America and offer a new asset class for investors, with complete transparency and security.

## 🚀 How It Works

LOANAD directly connects individuals who need a loan with those who wish to invest their money and generate returns, eliminating traditional intermediaries like banks.

- **P2P Lending**: Borrowers request loans, and investors fund them directly.
- **Onchain on Monad**: Everything is executed on the blockchain, providing traceability and transparency.
- **Smart Contracts**: They automate agreements, payments, and interest without the risk of manipulation.
- **Tokenization**: Loans can be represented as tokens to facilitate tracking and liquidity.
- **Trust and Community**: Inspired by the Māori Pikorua symbol, we aim to create a fair, sustainable, and reciprocal system.

## 📊 Key Benefits

- **For Borrowers**: Access to fair credit, even without a traditional credit history, with lower rates than those offered by banks.
- **For Investors**: Opportunity for diversification into a new asset class, with attractive returns and security guaranteed by smart contracts.

## 🌍 Context

- In Latin America, **70% of the population lacks access to formal credit** (Mastercard, 2023).
- Banks offer loans with annual rates ranging from **20% to 45%**.
- LOANAD seeks to **reduce these rates by up to 50%**, creating real financial inclusion.
